/**
 * Request class

 *
 * Getting updates
 * There are two mutually exclusive ways of receiving updates for your bot â€” the getUpdates method on one hand and Webhooks on the other. Incoming updates are stored on the server until the bot receives them either way, but they will not be kept longer than 24 hours.
 *
 * @method static Response getUpdates(array $data)      Use this method to receive incoming updates using long polling (wiki). An Array of Update objects is returned.
 * @method static Response setWebhook(array $data)      Use this method to specify a url and receive incoming updates via an outgoing webhook. Whenever there is an update for the bot, we will send an HTTPS POST request to the specified url, containing a JSON-serialized Update. In case of an unsuccessful request, we will give up after a reasonable amount of attempts. Returns true.
 * @method static Response deleteWebhook(array $data)   Use this method to remove webhook integration if you decide to switch back to getUpdates. Returns True on success.
 * @method static Response getWebhookInfo()             Use this method to get current webhook status. Requires no parameters. On success, returns a WebhookInfo object. If the bot is using getUpdates, will return an object with the url field empty.
 *
 *
 * Available methods
 * All methods in the Bot API are case-insensitive.
 *
 * @method static Response getMe()                                        A simple method for testing your bots auth token. Requires no parameters. Returns basic information about the bot in form of a User object.
 * @method static Response logOut()                                       Use this method to log out from the cloud Bot API server before launching the bot locally. Requires no parameters. Returns True on success.
 * @method static Response close()                                        Use this method to close the bot instance before moving it from one local server to another. Requires no parameters. Returns True on success.
